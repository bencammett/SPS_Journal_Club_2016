These are the records of the journal club held by the Society of Physics Students at the University at Buffalo during the Spring 2016 term.

I am making these available for those that wish to refer to them, as they were previously inaccessible to the public.

There are not many records, as we did not start until mid-way through the semester, and stopped shortly before final exams. However, they show what papers we were able to cover in the given time frame. We met once a week for 30 to 60 minutes, and each paper was selected by the designated presenter. Note: One paper, presented by Luke Lyle, is not accounted for as we have no known records.

Members:  Matthew Schiavi, Robert Waelder, Luke Lyle, Lisong Chen, Benjamin Cammett, Yuichi Okugawa, Giovanni Chiappone, Elijah Ramsey, and Jonathon Hayes.

Please do not hesitate to contact me with any questions or concerns.
